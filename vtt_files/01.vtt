Welcome to English for audiovisual production. My name is Alita Zaniolo. I am an artist and an

00:09.169 --> 00:13.369
English teacher, and I will be your English teacher throughout this course.

00:14.039 --> 00:20.800
But what can you expect to get from this course? This course consists in four different modules.

00:20.829 --> 00:24.570
It starts of with audiovisual communication technologies.

00:25.039 --> 00:31.070
In the second module, we will discuss setting the scene, and in this module we will discuss

00:31.070 --> 00:37.549
different terminologies and techniques that you will be using when setting a scene in your production

00:38.640 --> 00:45.450
The third module talks about the stages of creating an audio visual product and the last module, our

00:45.450 --> 00:51.250
fourth one, will help you to be able to communicate with the rest of your crew and team members.

00:51.259 --> 00:56.409
In this way, you will be developing teamwork skills throughout the course

00:56.420 --> 01:03.210
you will notice that I'll be showing slides now. If you really want to benefit fully from this course

01:03.219 --> 01:09.769
it would be good to have some paper and depend with you and some of these slides that I show will be

01:09.780 --> 01:13.359
exercises, and I will tell you to pause your video.

01:14.040 --> 01:19.459
So at that moment, take advantage of this and pause your video and work on the exercise on your piece

01:19.459 --> 01:25.269
of paper. That way you will be strengthening your English skills in every class that goes by.

01:25.939 --> 01:30.980
But now, without further ado, let's start with our first class, which is all about audiovisual communication technology.
