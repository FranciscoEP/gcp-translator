Welcome to English for audiovisual production. My name is Alita Zaniolo. I am an artist and an

2
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:13,369
English teacher, and I will be your English teacher throughout this course.

3
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:20,800
But what can you expect to get from this course? This course consists in four different modules.

4
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:24,570
It starts of with audiovisual communication technologies.

5
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,070
In the second module, we will discuss setting the scene, and in this module we will discuss

6
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:37,549
different terminologies and techniques that you will be using when setting a scene in your production

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,450
The third module talks about the stages of creating an audio visual product and the last module, our

8
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,250
fourth one, will help you to be able to communicate with the rest of your crew and team members.

9
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:56,409
In this way, you will be developing teamwork skills throughout the course

10
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:03,210
you will notice that I'll be showing slides now. If you really want to benefit fully from this course

11
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:09,769
it would be good to have some paper and depend with you and some of these slides that I show will be

12
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,359
exercises, and I will tell you to pause your video.

13
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,459
So at that moment, take advantage of this and pause your video and work on the exercise on your piece

14
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:25,269
of paper. That way you will be strengthening your English skills in every class that goes by.

15
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:30,980
But now, without further ado, let's start with our first class, which is all about audiovisual communication technology.
